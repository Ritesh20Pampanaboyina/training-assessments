Here is a brief overview of each sheet's content:

Test_Cases:

This sheet outlines various test cases (TCs) related to a "Percentage of Claims Extract."
It includes details such as:
Test Case Numbers (TC_1, TC_2, etc.)
Test Case Name (e.g., Database access, Positive Input Selection Criteria)
Other associated data for each test case.
Audit_Crosswalk_Details:

Contains mapping data between "Extract Table Names" and "Audit Table Names" for audits.
Also includes:
Program Names
Counts associated with the data.
Test_Results_Screenshots:

Appears to be a placeholder for screenshots with some empty fields.
The first column (TC_5, etc.) might represent test case numbers, while the rest of the columns contain references to results or notes.
Dev_Output_File:

This sheet has some high-level extraction information, mentioning things like:
Extract files based on Program IDs (e.g., PGM0000)
Sample XML file names (e.g., CA_QNXT_TEST_yyyyMMddhhmmss.xml)
Some rows appear to be placeholders or contain minimal data.
SQL_Execution_Plan:

This sheet is empty, implying no data is present for SQL execution plans in this version of the file.

Let's go through each sheet in more detail:

1. Test_Cases Sheet
This sheet provides details about various test cases (TC) relevant to a "Percentage of Claims Extract." Here's how the content is structured:

Test Case Number (TC_X): Each test case is identified by a unique number (TC_1, TC_2, etc.). This helps track the results and actions related to that specific test case.

Test Case Name: This column provides a brief description of what each test case is testing, such as:

Database Access: A test that likely checks whether access to the database is correctly implemented.
Database Object Validation: This verifies that specific database objects (tables, views, etc.) are correct and functioning as expected.
Input Selection Criteria: These tests ensure that the input data being selected for processing (e.g., claims) adheres to the specified criteria, both positive and negative.
Each row in this sheet would represent a specific test case, and the details would help guide the user through testing different functionalities of a system related to claim extraction.

2. Audit_Crosswalk_Details Sheet
This sheet appears to link or "crosswalk" between two sets of tables:

Extract Table Name: These are likely the original data tables or sources from which data is extracted.
Audit Table Name: These tables are used for audit purposes, possibly ensuring the accuracy of the extraction process.
There are additional fields like:

Program Name: Identifies the specific program or system being used, such as the application or tool managing the claims data.
Count: The number of records or items being referenced, possibly helping validate that the data has been correctly extracted or audited.
This sheet would be useful for auditing purposes, ensuring that extracted data aligns with the correct audit tables.

3. Test_Results_Screenshots Sheet
This sheet seems to contain placeholders or references to screenshots and results. The first column shows the test case (e.g., TC_5), and the remaining columns might contain screenshots or logs related to the outcome of those test cases.

In this sheet:

Unnamed Columns: Likely references for where the test results are stored or displayed. The third column includes notes or additional details about what was tested, such as, “Fetching 1% of all claim data.”
This sheet would help document the actual results visually or in a text-based format, making it easier to review the outcomes of each test case.

4. Dev_Output_File Sheet
This sheet contains details on files generated as output from the development process. For example:

Program IDs: Unique identifiers for each program or job (e.g., PGM0000) used during the extraction process.
File Names: Example filenames generated during the process (e.g., CA_QNXT_TEST_yyyyMMddhhmmss.xml).
It appears that this sheet is documenting which files were generated based on specific processes or jobs run during testing or development.

5. SQL_Execution_Plan Sheet
This sheet is currently empty. If it were filled, it might provide details on how SQL queries were executed. An SQL execution plan typically describes:

How the database processes and retrieves data.
Efficiency details, such as time taken, resources used, and potential bottlenecks.
An SQL execution plan helps optimize the database's performance, but since the sheet is empty, there’s no data to analyze in this case.

Would you like me to analyze or explain a specific row or column in more detail? Or perhaps walk through a specific test case or extraction process?
