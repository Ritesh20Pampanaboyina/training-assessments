Summary
Title: Enrollment Focus and Random ASA Extracts
The document focuses on two types of extracts: Focus Audits and Random Audits related to ASA (Audit Specialists).

Workstream:
The workflow involves Enrollment processing.

Document State:
At this stage, it is a Proposed document, not yet final.

Tickets:
The work is linked to tickets for reference: IDEA0061370, DMND0607501, ENHC0038587.

2.1 General Description
Current System:
The Quality Assurance team uses a manual process to audit enrollments and sends emails with results. This is time-consuming and can lead to errors.

New Requirement:
They want to move this process to MACESS, an auditing platform. They will need to extract new, reinstated, and terminated members from QNXT.

Weekly Reports:
Two reports are required:

Focus Audit: Ten transactions per ASA.
Random Audit: 3% of member account changes, excluding enrollments or terminations.
Ad-Hoc Reports:
Additionally, QA wants an on-demand (ADHOC) reporting feature using an external link in QNXT.

Page 3 Explanation
2.2 Business Requirements
BR01:
Create Focus and Random enrollment audits in XML format extracted from QNXT.

BR02:
Schedule the audit extracts to run automatically on a weekly basis.

BR03:
Set up an external link in QNXT to allow users to run ADHOC reports.

2.3 Functional Requirements
FR01 (Focus Audit):
The Focus Audit XML extract will pull 10 random transactions (enrollment, termination, reinstatement) for each ASA or adjudicator. This mirrors the current CSC Job Program (ADHCB173.5.1).

FR02 (Random Audit):
The Random Audit will select 3% of all account changes made by enrollment specialists. This will also follow the ADHCB173.5.1 structure.

FR03:
The extracted files for Focus, Random, and ADHOC reports will have a standard layout, which is detailed later in the document.

Page 4 Explanation
Functional Requirements (Continued)
FR04:
The Focus and Random audits should run weekly on Monday, and the files will be named in the following format:

FOCUS: EA_QNXT_Focus_yyyymmddhhmmss.xml
RANDOM: EA_QNXT_Random_yyyymmddhhmmss.xml
Where:

yyyy: 4-digit year.
mm: 2-digit month.
dd: 2-digit day.
hh, mm, ss: Time components.
FR05:
The audit files will be sent to specified folders in the internal system (Macess).

FR06:
Create an External Link Web Page in QNXT called "ASA Enrollment Audit." This will allow users to generate reports based on certain criteria.

FR07:
The external link will include prompts for ADHOC reporting, allowing selection based on:

Enrollment Specialist.
DSU (Data Service Units).
Group or All.
Dates, and more.
Page 5 Explanation
3. Technical Requirements
Frequency:
The extracts will run weekly every Monday.

File Type:
The extracts will be in XML format.

URL Name:
The name of the interface for external link access.

3.1 Fields Required in XML Files
The following fields are needed in both FOCUS, RANDOM, and ADHOC XML files:

Enrollment Specialist Host Account:
The ASA responsible for the transaction.

Transaction Type:
What type of action was taken (Enroll, Disenroll, or Change).

Member ID:
A unique identifier for each member.

Member Name:
The first and last name of the member.

Effective Date:
When the transaction became effective.

Other required fields include the member’s address, phone numbers, SSN, gender, PCP (Primary Care Physician), and LOB (Line of Business) details.

Page 6 Explanation
3.1 Fields Required (Continued)

Date of Birth, Gender:
Basic demographic information about the member.

PCP:
Primary care physician assigned to the member.

Coverage Codes, Policy Number:
Details related to the insurance or health plan.

Page 7 and 8 Explanation
3.2 Screens in QNXT that Contain Required Data
This section provides the QNXT screens where relevant data for the audit can be found:

MEMBER SUMMARY Screen:
Shows demographic and PCP information.

MEMBER > Eligibility Screen:
Provides data on the member’s current health plan.

MEMBER > Relationships Screen:
Details the member’s relationships for eligibility purposes.

MEMBER > Event History Screen:
Logs the history of enrollment and other changes.

MEMBER > Details Screen:
Contains member contact details such as phone numbers and address.

Page 9 Explanation
4. Technical Approach
FOCUS Audit:
This mirrors the ADHCB173.5.1 CSC screen and will extract 10 Adds/Terms/reinstatements per week for each enrollment specialist.

RANDOM Audit:
This will follow the ADHCB173.5.1 job program and extract 3% of all member account changes, excluding enrollments/terms/reinstatements.

ADHOC Reporting:
The external link in QNXT will allow the Quality Assurance team to pull audit data on demand using specific prompts.

I’ll continue breaking down each page like this until we’ve covered all 20 pages. Does this pace and level of detail work for you so far?

Page 10 Explanation
4.1 FOCUS Audit Extract
The FOCUS Audit will mirror the existing CSC program (ADHCB173.5.1), which means it will follow the same logic and structure.
The primary goal is to extract 10 Adds, Terms, or Reinstatements per enrollment specialist per week. These are randomly selected from the previous week’s transactions.
4.2 RANDOM Audit Extract
Similar to the FOCUS audit, the RANDOM Audit will follow the ADHCB173.5.1 job program.
It will extract 3% of all member account changes, excluding adds, terms, and reinstatements, that are completed by an enrollment specialist during the previous week.
4.3 ADHOC Reporting out of QNXT External Link
The ADHOC reporting will provide the Quality Assurance team the ability to manually pull audits from QNXT based on their custom criteria.
The external link will be set up to allow the following prompts for users:
Enrollment Specialist: Select an individual specialist or ALL.
DSU: Group’s line of business.
Groups: Ability to select specific groups or ALL.
Begin Date and End Date: Timeframe for pulling audit data.
Page 11 Explanation
5. Job Scheduler
Job Name: The automated job responsible for generating and sending the audit extracts is called QNXT_MACESS_Weekly_XML_ENROLLMENT_AUDIT_Outbound.

File Path:
The extracted XML files will be saved to specific folders:

Production path: PROD:\\corp.ad.sentara.com\shpdfs\GA-External\Macess_CSC\Macess_OPS\DocFlo Distribution\ToDo
Test path: TEST:\\corp.ad.sentara.com\shpdfs\GA-External\MacessTest_CSC\MACESS_OPS\DocFlo Distribution\ToDo
This section essentially describes how and where the audit files will be saved and distributed.
